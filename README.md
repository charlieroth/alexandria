# `alexandria`

A toy project that implements the back office software of a Library. This project is intended for me to implement a small(ish) software system in Go, built and orchestrated with Docker and Kubernetes and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. 

The hope is that by building `alexandria` I will develop a strong foundation for what it means to build Go applications using understandable software design principles, modern software orchestration tooling, and a enterprise cloud environment. I have done bits and pieces of those points with varying degrees of depth but now I would like to do all of those actions solo, from the bottom to the top.

Applies the practices of Bill Kennedy, a great Go instructor (among other things), which are nicely summarized in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQgNYK1Z5ho) video and implemented in [this](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service) Git repository.
